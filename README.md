**Socorro Designer**
===========
Developing an HTML app is a pain - requiring a multitude of libraries, hacks, and layers of tags just to set up the GUI. Socorro Designer helps alleviate that problem by helping you focus on the design and generating clean HTML5 code with connected javascript events when you're finished designing. It's a simple, cross platform user interface designer for HTML5 apps, inspired by Glade Interface Designer and Microsoft Blend.

This is a project I just started. Except for a few basic features, *it does not work yet*, but its development is active and it should reach beta stage by December
